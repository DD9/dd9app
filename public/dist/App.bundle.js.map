Each instance of the API class has\n\t * a \"context\" - i.e. the tables that it will operate on. This could be a single\n\t * table, all tables on a page or a sub-set thereof.\n\t *\n\t * Additionally the API is designed to allow you to easily work with the data in\n\t * the tables, retrieving and manipulating it as required. This is done by\n\t * presenting the API class as an array like interface. The contents of the\n\t * array depend upon the actions requested by each method (for example\n\t * `rows().nodes()` will return an array of nodes, while `rows().data()` will\n\t * return an array of objects or arrays depending upon your table's\n\t * configuration). The API object has a number of array like methods (`push`,\n\t * `pop`, `reverse` etc) as well as additional helper methods (`each`, `pluck`,\n\t * `unique` etc) to assist your working with the data held in a table.\n\t *\n\t * Most methods (those which return an Api instance) are chainable, which means\n\t * the return from a method call also has all of the methods available that the\n\t * top level object had. For example, these two calls are equivalent:\n\t *\n\t *     // Not chained\n\t *     api.row.add( {...} );\n\t *     api.draw();\n\t *\n\t *     // Chained\n\t *     api.row.add( {...} ).draw();\n\t *\n\t * @class DataTable.Api\n\t * @param {array|object|string|jQuery} context DataTable identifier. This is\n\t *   used to define which DataTables enhanced tables this API will operate on.\n\t *   Can be one of:\n\t *\n\t *   * `string` - jQuery selector.

This is the\n\t\t *   default that DataTables uses (incrementally increased for each column).\n\t\t * * `string` - read an object property from the data source. There are\n\t\t *   three 'special' options that can be used in the string to alter how\n\t\t *   DataTables reads the data from the source object:\n\t\t *    * `.` - Dotted Javascript notation. Just as you use a `.` in\n\t\t *      Javascript to read from nested objects, so to can the options\n\t\t *      specified in `data`. For example: `browser.version` or\n\t\t *      `browser.name`. If your object parameter name contains a period, use\n\t\t *      `\\\\` to escape it - i.e. `first\\\\.name`.\n\t\t *    * `[]` - Array notation. DataTables can automatically combine data\n\t\t *      from and array source, joining the data with the characters provided\n\t\t *      between the two brackets. For example: `name[, ]` would provide a\n\t\t *      comma-space separated list from the source array. If no characters\n\t\t *      are provided between the brackets, the original array source is\n\t\t *      returned.\n\t\t *    * `()` - Function notation. Adding `()` to the end of a parameter will\n\t\t *      execute a function of the name given. For example: `browser()` for a\n\t\t *      simple function on the data source, `browser.version()` for a\n\t\t *      function in a nested property or even `browser().version` to get an\n\t\t *      object property if the function called returns an object. Note that\n\t\t *      function notation is recommended for use in `render` rather than\n\t\t *      `data` as it is much simpler to use as a renderer.\n\t\t * * `null` - use the original data source for the row rather than plucking\n\t\t *   data directly from it. This action has effects on two other\n\t\t *   initialisation options:\n\t\t *    * `defaultContent` - When null is given as the `data` option and\n\t\t *      `defaultContent` is specified for the column, the value defined by\n\t\t *      `defaultContent` will be used for the cell.\n\t\t *    * `render` - When null is used for the `data` option and the `render`\n\t\t *      option is specified for the column, the whole data source for the\n\t\t *      row is used for the renderer.\n\t\t * * `function` - the function given will be executed whenever DataTables\n\t\t *   needs to set or get the data for a cell in the column. The function\n\t\t *   takes three parameters:\n\t\t *    * Parameters:\n\t\t *      * `{array|object}` The data source for the row\n\t\t *      * `{string}` The type call data requested - this will be 'set' when\n\t\t *        setting data or 'filter', 'display', 'type', 'sort' or undefined\n\t\t *        when gathering data. Note that when `undefined` is given for the\n\t\t *        type DataTables expects to get the raw data for the object back<\n\t\t *      * `{*}` Data to set when the second parameter is 'set'.\n\t\t *    * Return:\n\t\t *      * The return value from the function is not required when 'set' is\n\t\t *        the type of call, but otherwise the return is what will be used\n\t\t *        for the data requested.\n\t\t *\n\t\t * Note that `data` is a getter and setter option. If you just require\n\t\t * formatting of data for output, you will likely want to use `render` which\n\t\t * is simply a getter and thus simpler to use.\n\t\t *\n\t\t * Note that prior to DataTables 1.9.2 `data` was called `mDataProp`. The\n\t\t * name change reflects the flexibility of this property and is consistent\n\t\t * with the naming of mRender.

What the virtual rendering means\n * is that only the visible portion of the table (and a bit to either side to make\n * the scrolling smooth) is drawn, while the scrolling container gives the\n * visual impression that the whole table is visible. This is done by making use\n * of the pagination abilities of DataTables and moving the table around in the\n * scrolling container DataTables adds to the page. The scrolling container is\n * forced to the height it would be for the full table display using an extra\n * element.\n *\n * Note that rows in the table MUST all be the same height. Information in a cell\n * which expands on to multiple lines will cause some odd behaviour in the scrolling.\n *\n * Scroller is initialised by simply including the letter 'S' in the sDom for the\n * table you want to have this feature enabled on. Note that the 'S' must come\n * AFTER the 't' parameter in `dom`.\n *\n * Key features include:\n *   <ul class=\"limit_length\">\n *     <li>Speed! The aim of Scroller for DataTables is to make rendering large data sets fast</li>\n *     <li>Full compatibility with deferred rendering in DataTables for maximum speed</li>\n *     <li>Display millions of rows</li>\n *     <li>Integration with state saving in DataTables (scrolling position is saved)</li>\n *     <li>Easy to use</li>\n *   </ul>\n *\n *  @class\n *  @constructor\n *  @global\n *  @param {object} dt DataTables settings object or API instance\n *  @param {object} [opts={}] Configuration object for FixedColumns.
